Even if it was tested on YouTube,\r\nit is likely to work on other site that use HTML5 video\r\n\r\nThe browser of choice is Google Chrome and should work on the other webkit browsers. It does not work on Mozilla Firefox.\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n----\r\n\r\nLately you can find more and more lectures on YouTube. These lectures can be very long. Would not be great to watch it at an increased speed?\r\nYouTube let you select some standard multiplicators (x1.5 and x2) out of the box. However for me x2 is too fast and but I can definitely go faster than x1.5\r\nI created this bookmarklet to enable me to have a little more customization. In particular I usually can watch lecture at x1.75 but it ultimately depends on the speaker speed.\r\nThis bookmarklet let me easily adjust the speed. \r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nThe installation is pretty simple. It is a bookmarklet like the Pinterest's Pin It.\r\n\r\n[Their instructions](http://pinterest.com/about/goodies/) are really clear and will work also for YouTube Video Speed Changer.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately github does not let me to add a bookmarklet on this page. Use this page instead: http://youtube-video-speed-changer-bookmarklet.github.com\r\n\r\n\r\nRemember to enable HTML5 video on YouTube at http://www.youtube.com/html5\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\nOnce it is on your bookmarks, you can click on \"Change Speed\". A small box shows \r\nup in the upper left corner. You can use the + or - buttons to increase or\r\ndiminish the speed of the video.\r\n\r\nClick it again and the small speed box will disappear and the video will go back\r\nto normal speed.   \r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nÂ© 2012, Chris Cinelli.
